/**	
 * 	This is a Project from my design's pattern class on creating a text control system for airports
 * 	it fulfills the requirements of creating a clean organized system that records flights under different airlines
 *  and allows for booking on these flights as well as looking for available flights from origin to destination.
 *  
 *  I will also probably be doing the extra credit optional section on extending the system to cover the other modes of transportation
 * 	
 *	I have set out to add to the difficulty of this project by utilizing EGit system within eclipse to familiarize myself with the GIT version control system
 *	even if I am not fully getting used to using the command-line commands, but at least I'm still getting into the habit of using commits, making branches,
 *	and making full use of such an incredibly convenient tool.
