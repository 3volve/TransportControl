/**	
 * 	This is a Project from my design's pattern class on creating a text control system for airports
 * 	it fulfills the requirements of creating a clean organized system that records flights under different airlines
 *  and allows for booking on these flights as well as looking for available flights from origin to destination.
 *  
 *  I will also probably be doing the extra credit optional section on extending the system to cover the other modes of transportation
 * 	
 *	I have set out to add to the difficulty of this project by utilizing EGit system within eclipse to familiarize myself with the GIT version control system
 *	even if I am not fully getting used to using the command-line commands, but at least I'm still getting into the habit of using commits, making branches,
 *	and making full use of such an incredibly convenient tool.



My loopy-tired journaling section...
I definitely didn't do an entirely expansive job of demoing every single aspect of my program, I've probably sunk closing in on 40 hours into this at this point, 
and almost 12 of those hours today alone, so it might suffice to say I'm rather tired and running out of time.  I did my best with the time I have, I probably
could put another 20 hours into this before being satisfied but that's just my perfectionism.  

I'm about to do one last push to my git server before leaving this behind for a week or so before going back to polish it up to use as a demo project.
I actually greatly enjoyed it as a good challenge (I think this is just turning into me journaling at this point, my apologies you don't need to read this if you've
got other things to do)  I feel a lot more comfortable with git, it definitely saved my ass on several occasions. I see tons of holes in my good designing practices
and feel equipped to know some things I could do differently next time, and I know a couple things that I just don't have time to fix, such as my sections for cruise
aren't being made properly for some reason.  Anyways I used a shit ton of different things, far too much to attempt to document in the 13 minutes I have left, so I'll
instead touch upon some of the things I would do differently if I had to re-do this project again!  I would probably put a lot more effort into keeping all my 
concrete classes identical (following liskov's substitution) and probably work out an adapter for the Cruiseline so I could still have ships attached to it.  I also
could have maybe used some extra classes in printing out the whole thing, maybe had a seperate class with the sole duty of printing out systemmanager, I dunno, but I
do know I'm both out of brain-power and out of time, so I guess it's time to turn this in!
